**Abstract**. Our project is an attempt to understand epileptic seizures by answering any researcher's questions about a phenomenon: why, where and when using Python. In order to answer these questions, we first analyzed the EEG data of patients from the CHB-MIT database. After making typographic maps of the electrodes over time, we were able to identify the seizure onset zone in the interictal and ictal periods. Indicating that epilepsies arise from an organized interaction in the brain and are interconnected. We then used ECG data from other research on epilepsy patients to reconstruct their biological clocks based on their heart rate cycles and then test for similarity with epileptic cycles. We identified that epilepsies are related to the cardiac cycles of patients, since after all they affect the autonomic nervous system. Finally, two block diagrams were designed for a monitoring system in clinics (EEG, ECG) and a portable one that would be a smartwatch. For this last part, accelerometer data was extracted, created an app with swift and java and connected to a server on the web. It was demonstrated how using the signals collected and various classification methods could detect epileptic episodes.
